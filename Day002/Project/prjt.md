# Tip Calculator

## Instructions

1. Create a greeting for your program.
2. Ask for the bill
3. Ask for the tip percentage
4. Ask for the number of people to split the bill with.
5. Calculate the total bill and the bill per person.
6. Display the bill per person with 2 decimal places.

- If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
- Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
- Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
